## Project Evolution

1.  **Phase I: Console Todo App** (COMPLETED)
    - Source and Docs: `Phase-one/`
    - Status: Uploaded to GitHub subfolder.
2.  **Phase II: Full-Stack Web App** (ACTIVE)
    - Source and Docs: `Phase-two/`
    - Backend: `backend/` (FastAPI)
    - Frontend: `frontend/` (Next.js)

## Project Structure

```
Todo-app/
├── backend/          # FastAPI logic (Phase 2)
├── frontend/         # Next.js UI (Phase 2)
├── Phase-one/        # Legacy Console App (Completed)
├── Phase-two/        # Active Phase 2 Specifications & History

## How to Work

- For **Phase 2 Development**, always refer to the specifications and history inside `Phase-two/`.
- Maintain Prompt History (PHR) within `Phase-two/history/prompts/`.
- Strategic guidelines are defined in `Phase-two/.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## Active Specs (Phase 2)
All active specs are located in `Phase-two/specs/`:
- `002-phase2-fullstack/`
- `003-todo-web-ui/`
